KINARM Simulink Project: Technical Description
In this project, I developed Simulink based tasks for the KINARM robotic exoskeleton. Specifically, I used Stateflow and Simulinkin order to study pre-shot routine as it relates to intiating voluntary movements. I was tasked with designing a task which would allow a participant to perform collisions with an object while seated in the exoskelaton to study the phenomenon of pre-shot routine. These tasks were engineered to operate in real-time, leveraging the KINARM system’s capabilities to deliver high-precision measurement of upper-limb kinematics.

Signal routing and organization were achieved using Bus Creator and Bus Selector blocks for hierarchical structuring of complex datasets, while Mux and Demux blocks facilitated vectorization and selective signal splitting. Inter-subsystem communication relied extensively on Goto and From blocks to maintain clarity and avoid excessive wiring in large-scale models. Logical flow was constructed using Relational Operators, Logical Operators, and conditional routing through Switch and Multiport Switch blocks, enabling real-time decision-making based on task events and kinematic thresholds. Enabled and Triggered Subsystems were employed for state-dependent subsystem execution, crucial for precise timing control. A significant portion of the project focused on timing and sample rate management. I implemented fixed-step solvers to ensure deterministic real-time behavior, while Rate Transition blocks mediated safe data transfer between blocks operating at different sampling rates. This was particularly important for synchronizing high-frequency sensor inputs with computationally heavier processing blocks and Stateflow charts.

In Stateflow, I developed hierarchical state machines defining discrete experimental phases, such as Pre-Trial Delay, Cue Presentation, Active Reach, Collision Detection, and Return-to-Center. State transitions were governed by a combination of kinematic event flags and temporal logic, leveraging constructs like after(), duration(), and guarded transitions to ensure precise control over experiment timing. Parallel states allowed simultaneous monitoring of asynchronous processes—for instance, maintaining collision detection logic alongside primary trial progression. I implemented Embedded MATLAB Function blocks to handle computational routines not directly available via standard Simulink blocks. These included custom geometric algorithms for real-time collision detection between circular hand cursors and rectangular obstacles, randomized target generation logic to introduce trial variability, and coordinate transformations necessary for mapping between KINARM’s native coordinate space and experimental task space.
Real-time data acquisition and analysis were critical components of the project. I configured the models to capture continuous kinematic data, including 2D hand trajectories, instantaneous velocities, acceleration profiles, and task-specific metrics such as time-to-target and endpoint accuracy. Visual feedback was integrated into the task, providing dynamic rendering of cursor positions, target locations, and obstacles in real-time, which was essential for participant engagement and experimental validity.

Beyond model development, I authored comprehensive documentation and standard operating procedures to facilitate future extensions and team onboarding. I also developed MATLAB post-processing scripts to parse trial data, extract key metrics, and generate plots for behavioral and statistical analyses.

Throughout the project, I encountered and resolved multiple technical challenges, including Goto/From block mismatches, signal dimension inconsistencies, solver configuration issues affecting real-time performance, and the integration of custom code with Dexterit-E for KINARM task deployment. My work resulted in reusable, parameterized Simulink templates capable of rapid adaptation to new experimental designs and provided a robust platform for exploring human motor control and neurorehabilitation applications.

This project pushed the boundaries of understanding and problem solving with systems. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn and grow from these experiences.
